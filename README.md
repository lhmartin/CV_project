# CV_project
Final Project for NYU Computer Vision Fall 2019

The bulk of our work went to these files:


- sslime/extra_scripts/JigSaw/*
- sslime/extra_scripts/JigSaw_and_Rot/*
- sslime/sslime/sslime/models/heads/jig_head.py
- sslime/sslime/sslime/models/trunks/rot_jig.py

- sslime/sslime/sslime/data/ssl_transforms/rot_jig.py


You will have to make a conda enviroment to run this, use req_slime.yml for that.
